nmap Workshop
=============

This is a workshop planned to be given at Phreaknic 20 on November 4-6 2016,
Murfreesboro, TN.

This workshop is still being planned and isn't ready for general consumption
yet.

Abstract
--------

Nmap (“Network Mapper”) is an open source tool for network exploration and
security auditing. It is often the first tool for which pentesters reach.
This workshop is designed to get absolute beginners off the ground and running
with one of the best tools in information security.

Goal
----
By the end of this workshop, an understanding of basic network surveying to get
started with a pentest engagement or better your own networks should be achieved
by participants.

> At the end, I want you to know how to run an nmap command and discover other
systems on your local network, or open ports on a specific system.
